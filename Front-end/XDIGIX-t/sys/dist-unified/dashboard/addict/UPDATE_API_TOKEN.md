# ⚠️ Update API Token in Dashboard

## The Problem

You're seeing: `"API token not configured"`

This means the API token in your **XDIGIX Dashboard** doesn't match the one in the website code.

## ✅ Solution: Update Token in Dashboard

### Step 1: Go to External Website Settings

1. Open: **https://madas-store.web.app**
2. Login to your account
3. Navigate to: **E-commerce → External Website**

### Step 2: Update the API Token

1. **In "Outbound API" section:**
   - Find the **"API Token"** field
   - **Replace** the existing token with: `OESmdd44zV2zI5j4o-FB5d8-LSE-sZRhc60WmO13EFA`
   - Or click **"Generate"** to create a new one, then copy it

2. **Make sure:**
   - ✅ "Enable integration" toggle is ON (top of page)
   - ✅ "Enable API" toggle is ON (in Outbound API section)
   - ✅ API Token field has the token: `OESmdd44zV2zI5j4o-FB5d8-LSE-sZRhc60WmO13EFA`

3. **Click "Save"** button

### Step 3: Verify

After saving:
1. Wait 10-30 seconds for settings to propagate
2. Refresh the website: **https://addict-123.web.app**
3. Products should now load! ✅

## Important Notes

- The API token in the **dashboard** must match the token in the **website code**
- Both must be exactly the same (no extra spaces)
- Changes don't apply until you click "Save"
- It may take 10-30 seconds for changes to take effect

## Current Configuration

**Website Code (already updated):**
- API Token: `OESmdd44zV2zI5j4o-FB5d8-LSE-sZRhc60WmO13EFA` ✅

**Dashboard (needs update):**
- API Token: Must be set to: `OESmdd44zV2zI5j4o-FB5d8-LSE-sZRhc60WmO13EFA`

**Once you update the dashboard, the website will work! 🎉**
